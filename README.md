Additional features:
Added a timer that would set the object inactive after a set amount of time. this was to make sure if a ball didn't hit the platform it could still be used later.
Made the collision only work when a ball hits the floor instead of just hitting anything.
Have a random delay between balls spawns and despawns.
Randomly use 10-15 balls from the queue.
